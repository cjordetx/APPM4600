This repo contains all work pertaining to APPM 4600 made or edited by Christian Ordetx during Fall 2024. Currently there are two active folders, Homework and Labs, that contain their corresponding assignments inside. Inside the Labs and Homework folders is a sub folder containing the work from each individual lab or homework. Most files will likely be made using python 3 and are of the form .py. I plan to add more to this repo soon including information pertaining the final project as that becomes relevant throughout the semester.
